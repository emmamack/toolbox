Through experimenting with changing mutation rates and DEAP algorithms, I've concluded:

- The eaMuPlusLambda algorithm is faster than the euSimple algorithm.

- The optimal mutation probability (of deletion or substitution or insertion) to optimize speed is about 0.1.
I ran two tests with each of (0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) as the probabilities on a 9-character goal string and the results are as follows:
0.05 --> 16, 17 s
0.1 --> 9, 9 s
0.15 --> 9, 10 s
0.2 --> 12, 11 s
These tests weren't incredibly scientific; for future steps I would sweep a more detailed range of values.
